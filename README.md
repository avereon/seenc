Clones or pulls repositories from Git providers like GitHub, BitBucket, etc. 

The motivation for the project was to have command line tool to synchronize
all repositories for a user, team, account or other group defined by a provider. 
This allows the user to get up-to-date in one step instead of having to update 
each repository individually. This is especially helpful cloning initial copies 
of all repositories in the group when setting up a new computer.
